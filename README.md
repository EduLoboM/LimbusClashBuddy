# LimbusClashBuddy 🕗⛓️

Limbus Clash Buddy is a visual calculator designed specifically for Limbus Company. Using Monte Carlo simulation, this Windows Forms application estimates the victory chance based on in-game parameters.

### Overview 🚂👿

This tool allows you to enter various parameters related to both allies and enemies (such as base power, coin numbers, coin power, and sanity). It then simulates numerous rounds using a binomial distribution approach and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the overall victory chance. Based on the result, the application updates the interface by displaying either a winning or losing image.

### Features 💀👻

Monte Carlo Simulation: Estimates victory probability by simulating multiple rounds.
User-Friendly Interface: A Windows Forms design where users can input parameters and see results instantly.
Dynamic Visual Feedback: Changes the displayed image based on simulation outcomes.

### How It Works 🧠👁
#### Input: 
Enter values for ally and enemy parameters such as base clash power, coin numbers, coin power, and sanity.

#### Simulation:
The application calculates the chance for each side using binomial distribution and performs Monte Carlo simulations.

#### Output:
The victory chance is displayed in percentage form. The background image changes according to the result
### Getting Started 🍎☄️
#### Prerequisites
Windows OS (for running the executable)
.NET Framework (as required by the application)
Running the Executable
Simply locate the compiled executable file (e.g., LimbusClashBuddy.exe) in the project folder, and double-click it to launch the application.

The tool is inspired by the mechanics of Limbus Company.
It uses parameters that mirror in-game statistics and probabilities.
If you're familiar with Limbus Company, you'll appreciate how the simulation mirrors the decision-making challenges in the game.
